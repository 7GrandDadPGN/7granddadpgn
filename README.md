## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm 7GrandDad, a developer, known for my now-deleted-because-I-went-too-far-because-someone-said-I-fake-quit Vape for Roblox & Miniblox Translation Layer!
(seriously, publish them again, you went too far)

### Links to forks/archives of my projects (suggest in PR #6 for more)

Vape for Roblox: https://github.com/pirateware/VapeV4ForRoblox/ or https://github.com/TheFinality/VapeV4ForRoblox/pull/260
Vape for Miniblox: https://codeberg.org/RealPacket/VapeForMiniblox (I maintain it myself to make it work on the latest versions, basically just remove all my commits and then it's upstream Vape for Miniblox, but it won't work)
Miniblox Translation Layer: https://codeberg.org/RealPacket/MinibloxTranslationLayer / https://github.com/DataM0del/MinibloxTranslationLayer (checkout last commit by 7GrandDad if you want original, note that the GitHub one won't work since vector added version checks, but you can easily fix it)

### Always wishing everyone a good day wherever I go :)
